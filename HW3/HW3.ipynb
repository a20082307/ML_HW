However, if you use the softmax and the cross entropy loss, that complexity fades away. Since the softmax layer is usually used at the output, we can actually calculate the derivative of the categorical cross-entropy loss with respect to the n-th node in the last hidden layer. Instead of a long clunky formula, you end up with this terse, easy to compute thing: $$\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial Z_i} = s_i - y_i $$, where $s$ is the output of the softmax function and the $y$ is the true label vector(one-hot vector).

However, both approaches - the one-node technique (eg. using sigmoid activation + binary cross-entropy loss) and the two-node technique (eg. using softmax activation + categorical cross-entropy loss) - are effective for binary classification. The choice between these techniques is often based on personal preference. For this assignment, in the binary classification, you will use the former approach which is the more common practice, and the latter approach with focal loss (not CCE), due to its ease of implementation.\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":13,"metadata":{"id":"6yVQQqe2EyHA"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["With sigmoid: A = [[0.64565631]\n"," [0.20915937]\n"," [0.77902611]]\n","With ReLU: A = [[0.6 ]\n"," [0.  ]\n"," [1.26]]\n","With softmax: A = \n","[[0.47535001 0.14317267 0.38147732]\n"," [0.05272708 0.75380161 0.19347131]\n"," [0.68692136 0.05526942 0.25780921]]\n"]}],"source":["A_prev, W, b = np.array([[0.1, 1.1, 2.9],[-1.2, 0.2, -2.5],[1.9, 2.3, 3.7]]), np.array([[0.1], [0.2], [0.3]]), np.array([[-0.5]])\n","model = Model([3, 1], [\"sigmoid\"], \"cross_entropy\")\n","model.linear[0].parameters = {\"W\": W, \"b\": b}\n","A = model.forward(A_prev)\n","print(\"With sigmoid: A = \" + str(A))\n","A_prev, W, b = np.array([[4.35, -5.67], [-7.89, 8.12]]), np.array([[-3.54], [-2.34]]), np.array([[0.8]])\n","model = Model([2, 1], [\"sigmoid\"], \"cross_entropy\")\n","model.linear[0].parameters = {\"W\": W, \"b\": b}\n","A = model.forward(A_prev)\n","outputs[\"model_forward_sigmoid\"] = (A, (model.linear[0].cache, model.activation[0].cache))\n","\n","A_prev, W, b = np.array([[0.1, 1.1, 2.9],[-1.2, 0.2, -2.5],[1.9, 2.3, 3.7]]), np.array([[0.1], [0.2], [0.3]]), np.array([[-0.5]])\n","model = Model([3, 1], [\"relu\"], \"cross_entropy\")\n","model.linear[0].parameters = {\"W\": W, \"b\": b}\n","A = model.forward(A_prev)\n","print(\"With ReLU: A = \" + str(A))\n","A_prev, W, b = np.array([[7.23, -4.56], [5.67, -8.90]]), np.array([[-9.12], [3.45]]), np.array([[0.25]])\n","model = Model([2, 1], [\"relu\"], \"cross_entropy\")\n","model.linear[0].parameters = {\"W\": W, \"b\": b}\n","A = model.forward(A_prev)\n","outputs[\"model_forward_relu\"] = (A, (model.linear[0].cache, model.activation[0].cache))\n","\n","A_prev, W, b = np.array([[0.1, 1.1, 2.9],[-1.2, 0.2, -2.5],[1.9, 2.3, 3.7]]), np.array([[0.1, -0.1, -0.1],[0.2, -0.2, 0.],[0.3, -0.3, 0.1]]), np.array([[-0.5, 0.5, 0.1]])\n","model = Model([3, 3], [\"softmax\"], \"cross_entropy\")\n","model.linear[0].parameters = {\"W\": W, \"b\": b}\n","A = model.forward(A_prev)\n","print(\"With softmax: A = \\n\" + str(A))\n","A_prev, W, b = np.array([[-5.12, 4.56, 7.89], [8.34, -6.78, 2.45], [3.21, -4.67, 5.98]]), np.array([[6.23, -7.85, 4.56], [-3.21, 9.87, -2.34], [1.23, -5.67, 8.90]]), np.array([[4.12, -6.54, 7.89]])\n","model = Model([3, 3], [\"softmax\"], \"cross_entropy\")\n","model.linear[0].parameters = {\"W\": W, \"b\": b}\n","A = model.forward(A_prev)\n","outputs[\"model_forward_softmax\"] = (A, (model.linear[0].cache, model.activation[0].cache))"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"QMkf2ss6F52W"},"source":["Expected output:\n","<table>\n","  <tr>\n","    <td>With Sigmoid:</td>\n","    <td>A = [[0.64565631] [0.20915937] [0.77902611]]</td>\n","  </tr>\n","  <tr>\n","    <td>With ReLU:</td>\n","    <td>A = [[0.6 ] [0. ] [1.26]]</td>\n","  </tr>\n","  <tr>\n","    <td>With Softmax:</td>\n","    <td>A = [[0.47535001 0.14317267 0.38147732] [0.05272708 0.75380161 0.19347131] [0.68692136 0.05526942 0.25780921]]</td>\n","  </tr>\n","</table>"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":14,"metadata":{"id":"s26LVkCbIbJ3"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["AL = [[0.56058713]\n"," [0.55220559]\n"," [0.46331713]]\n","Length of layers list = 2\n","AL = [[0.11637212 0.08186754 0.0924809  0.09675205 0.12819411 0.09664001\n","  0.08448599 0.09067641 0.1294968  0.08303407]\n"," [0.11413265 0.08432761 0.09365443 0.09736489 0.12404237 0.09726785\n","  0.08664355 0.09207969 0.12512634 0.08536063]\n"," [0.09750771 0.07419482 0.08444682 0.10943351 0.09669465 0.11116299\n","  0.08734059 0.12452515 0.13002144 0.08467232]]\n","Length of layers list = 2\n"]}],"source":["# binary classification\n","X = np.array([[0, -2, 0.5], [1, -1, 0.5], [2, 0, 0.5]])\n","model = Model([3, 3, 1], [\"relu\", \"sigmoid\"], \"cross_entropy\")\n","AL = model.forward(X)\n","print(\"AL = \" + str(AL))\n","print(\"Length of layers list = \" + str(len(model.linear)))\n","\n","# multi-class classification\n","X = np.array([[0, -2, 0.5], [1, -1, 0.5], [2, 0, 0.5]])\n","model = Model([3, 3, 10], [\"relu\", \"softmax\"], \"cross_entropy\")\n","AL = model.forward(X)\n","print(\"AL = \" + str(AL))\n","# answer = list([\n","#     [0.11637212, 0.08186754, 0.0924809,  0.09675205, 0.12819411, 0.09664001, 0.08448599, 0.09067641, 0.1294968 , 0.08303407],\n","#     [0.11413265, 0.08432761, 0.09365443, 0.09736489, 0.12404237, 0.09726785, 0.08664355, 0.09207969, 0.12512634, 0.08536063],\n","#     [0.09750771, 0.07419482, 0.08444682, 0.10943351, 0.09669465, 0.11116299, 0.08734059, 0.12452515, 0.13002144, 0.08467232]\n","# ])\n","# for i in range(len(answer)):\n","#     for j in range(len(answer[0])):\n","#         if AL[i][j] -

Advanced implementation (multi class classification) (15%)\n","\n","In this section, you need to implement a multi-class classifier using the functions you had previously written. You will create a model that can classify ten handwritten digits. The MNIST handwritten digit classification problem is a standard dataset in computer vision and deep learning. We usually use convolutional deep-learning neural networks for image classification. However, using only dense layers appears to be enough to handle this simple dataset, and this is a good way to get started with image datasets.\n","\n","**Exercise**: Implement a multi-class classifier and tune hyperparameter.\n","\n","**Instruction**:\n","*   Use the functions you had previously written.\n","*   Preprocess the data to match the correct input format.\n","*   Use mini-batch gradient descent to train the model.\n","\n","**Hint**:\n","For data preprocessing, please be careful with the dimension of the inputs (X and y) and also note that the values of images are usually integers that fall between 0 and 255. You need to change the data type into float and scale the values between 0 and 1.\n","\n","In Batch Gradient Descent, we consider all the samples for every step of Gradient Descent. But what if our dataset is huge? You will get around 33000 training samples, then to take one step, the model will have to calculate the gradients of all the 33000 samples. This does not seem an efficient way.
